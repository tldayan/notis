This project represents my solution for the Notifications Page challenge provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). The challenge aimed to create a visually appealing page that displays notifications, allowing users to manage and interact with them effectively.

The Notifications Page challenge focused on building a user-friendly and interactive page for managing notifications. The goal was to create a design that effectively presents notifications, provides relevant actions, and enhances the overall user experience.
